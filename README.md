#Bootsharp

Bootsharp is SSL.com's official theme for Bootstrap. Bootsharp is to be used with bootstrap-sass v3. It is not yet compatible with Bootstrap v4.

##Excluded components
The following components are not included in Bootsharp:
 - Jumbotron
 - Tooltips
 - Popovers
 - Carousel

##How to build

Bootsharp requires NPM to run tasks.

 - `npm run build` compiles with source maps
 - `npm run dist` compiles minified without source maps
 - `npm start` compiles and watches for changes

 As an alternative, you can load `_variables.scss` and `_bootsharp.scss` into a bootstrap loader.
