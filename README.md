#Bootsharp

Bootsharp is SSL.com's official theme for Bootstrap. Bootsharp is to be used with bootstrap-sass v3. It is not yet compatible with Bootstrap v4.

##How to build

Bootsharp requires NPM and Gulp to compile.

 - `gulp` compiles with source maps
 - `gulp --production` compiles minified without source maps
 - `gulp watch` compiles and watches for changes

 As an alternative, you can load `_variables.scss` and `_bootsharp.scss` into a bootstrap loader.
